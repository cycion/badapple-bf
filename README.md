# Bad Apple in BF

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+, for modules see `requirements.txt`
- youtube-dl

## Run
```
chmod +x ./launch.sh
./launch.sh
```
The generated BF code is in `bfcode/` and each animation frame is in `text/`. 

Open the files in `output/` with a text editor to see the results.

Modify the FRAME_DELAY in txtplayer.py to your liking if the animation speed is too slow. Note that the lower this value, the more choppy the animation looks.
